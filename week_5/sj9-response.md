## Statement

T 2/4 Minako O’Hanagan – Transcreating Japanese Video Games
(*Translation and Translation Studies in Japan*, Chapter 10).

Industry insiders generally agree that without Japanese contributions the game sector would not have gone beyond “a passing fad” (Aoyama and Izushi 2003: 424). Commenting on the power shift in the video game industry from the United States to Japan, Consalvo (2006: 132) cautiously remarks that the flow of cultural dominance for consoles and many major games is currently in the direction from East to West, “with Japan leading production, the USA and Europe following.”

## Response (notes only)

- Sort of baffled by the inclusion of this statement about the "flow of cultural dominance for ... games".  It sounds like commentary on market movements having little to do with translation studies, and doesn't express a central theme of the chapter.

- The point of the chapter is really that "transcreation" breaks the wall between translation and creation: the localization process of a Japanese game which makes it appropriate to a foreign target market involves more than mere translation of text meanings into other languages.  This gives the "transcreator" a role in the creative process that they are normally denied... they're no longer obliged to be a transparent window from one culture to another, they need to deal with questions which affect the player's enjoyment of the product, which has culturally-bound aspects.

- Some interesting tidbits from the chapter:
    - the term translation in its narrow sense of converting verbal messages in one language into another, while localization refers to the broader process of “taking a product and making it linguistically and culturally appropriate to the target locale (country/region and language)”  p.186

    - While sharing localization elements that are common with other software products, such as translation of the user interface (UI), games require the translation of many different types of in-game text, including more literary as well as functional and technical text. The cinematics that are now regularly inserted in games also require translation in a form similar to subtitling and/or revoicing. p.187
