<p>T 1/21 Walter Benjamin – “The Task of The Translator”</p>
<p>“Translation is so far removed from being the sterile equation of two dead languages that of all literary forms it is the one charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process of the original language and the birth pangs of its own.” p.256</p>

<ul>
<li><p>“far removed from … the sterile equation of two dead languages” is hard to argue with, unless we’re talking about Ikea assembly instructions, which are always dead simple except for the 22 pages of language-specific hazard warnings, all of which say exactly the same thing: “don’t be an idiot.”</p></li>
<li><p>“… it is charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process… and the birth pangs…”: again, these folks could never be accused of not taking themselves seriously enough or treating translation as less than God’s own favorite activity.</p></li>
<li><p>I might slip in a comment about how the significance of the translator’s role ought to have least some relationship to the significance of the work being translated. Translating the McDonalds Kid’s Menu into Greek should not require one to touch the top of Mount Olympus with their tongue and carry the nectar back as a gift for mere mortals.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin#Writing_style">Wikipedia says</a> says “(Benjamin) posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth.”</p></li>

<h2 id="statement-1">Statement</h2>
<p>R 1/23 The <em>Tao Te Ching</em> in 3 Versions</p>
<p>Choose and analyze an interesting difference between the three versions of the text we read.</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only-1">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 1: Addiss &amp; Lombardo, p1-14</li>
<li>Version 2: Ursula K. Le Guin, p15-28</li>
<li>Version 3: D.C. Lau, p29-39</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 2 stands out for its liberal doses of Le Guin’s personal “insights” into the text, and its “common street vocabulary”: clearly she wants to make the famously cryptic text “accessible”, and could be accused of simply using it as a frame for her extensive philosophical footnotes.</p>
<p>I find a touch of hilarity on p17-18 (p4-5 relative) in which she states confidently that <em>“values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let go of that belief is to find safety.”</em></p>
<p>Where’s the hilarity? Well… everything that follows “values and beliefs are culturally constructed” is itself a statement of values and beliefs that seem to be claiming status as transcendent truth. This could all be restated with less posturing and greater self-awareness: “All values and beliefs except mine are culturally constructed.”</p>
<p>The text is printed by Shambhala in Boulder, CO – famous mainly for their endless flooding of the market with “spiritual guidance” translated for Westerners from exotic foreign authorities. So I bet this sold well.</p>
<p>Version 1 has no footnotes at all, as Addiss and Lombardo seem more conservative in believing that the reader is more interested in the translated text than their personal views of life and enlightenment. It’s also beautifully rendered, with ideograms presumably from the source decorating each page and a classic-poetry typography and indenting style, suggesting that the Tao transcends the words on the page perhaps.</p>
<p>The <em>Tao Te Ching</em> is full of contrasts and contradictions, trying always to push the reader off of their comfortable certainty into unfamiliar perspectives, and this version seems content to let that flow through the translation.</p>
<p>Version 3 eschews Le Guin’s personal narrative as well, but adds an apologetic tone: the footnotes point to the difficulty the translator had in finding the right phrases, e.g. <em>“The Chinese terms used here are not precise and it is not clear what the intended contrast is. The translation is, therefore, tentative.” (p6 relative)</em> It’s hard to imagine Le Guin admitting to such lack of confidence, and it’s a charming humility suggesting a workmanlike approach of the translator with an unglorified understanding of his own role: “try to make some sense of this in English and move on.”</p>

<h2 id="statement-2">Statement</h2>
<p>T 1/28 Sarah Maitland – <em>What is Cultural Translation</em>? Chapter 1 <strong>SJ 7</strong></p>
<p>“To qualify as cultural translation a phenomenon of human expression in the social sphere must be shown to engage in a contemplative work of understanding addressed towards a particular substance, but it must also have as its primary objective nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” p.53</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only-2">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 2 of the book is titled “Translation and the Space-Time Continuum” suggesting various avenues for mocking the spiritual/psychobabble/too-much-LSD perspective of the author. Everybody thinks their topic is cosmic, right?</p></li>
<li><p>The given statement suggests the primary objective is “nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” Again… Ms. Maitland doesn’t want to be an academic, she wants to be a guru. She settled but it still itches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The statement is the closing remark of chapter 1, so there’s no need to connect it to the chapter conclusion, it’s already there: given the lofty role she grants to interpretation <em>(“hermeneutics” is used 83 times in the book, often framed in terms that suggest it’s the central thing to understand about humans)</em>. Consider this passage from the intro (p7):</p>
<div>
<pre><code>*Hermeneutics, as elaborated by Ricoeur, is the ‘art’ of interpretation that questions the limits of our interpretation, a form of understanding that is not simply a way of knowing or a method of analysis but an ontological imperative: to understand who we are and where we stand before the objectfor-interpretation.*</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Ironically, I almost sort-of agree with her perspective about the importance of human meaning-making. I’m mostly annoyed not by the central idea but with the art-house posturing of the language used in the book. She’s trying to hard to impress someone we’ve never met, the old 10,000-words-doing-the-work-of-1000.</p>

<h2 id="statement-3">Statement</h2>
<p><strong>(Reading A)</strong> - “Modernity, development, interculturality and Sumak Kawsay or Living Well but not Better” &gt; R 1/30 Monica Chuji</p>
<p><strong>(Reading B)</strong> - Javier Cuestas-Caza “Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”</p>
<p>“I believe that interculturality must be put in a framework to find bridges in the transition between civilizations. That is to say, interculturality must be the form by which we conserve the best of this system, to be journeying towards a new system that surpasses Capitalism and modernity in a definitive way. Seen this way, interculturality becomes one of the most convenient forms to overcome development and journey towards sumak kawsay.” &gt; Monica Chuji, p. 3</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only-3">Response (notes only)</h2>
<p><strong>(From Reading A)</strong> – the “Modernity, development,…” reading contains fairly obvious errors</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g.:
<ul>
<li>“In these two year and a half years since the outbreak”: <em>(some sort of typo, possibly due to translation from Spanish)</em></li>
<li>“In 2007 the (GNP) of the United States was $13.86T. … the financial markets were allocated 40% of the amount of total wealth in the US.” <em>(This is completely wrong: the gross national product has nothing to do with the “total wealth” of a country. It’s the difference between “how much value did you create this year?” vs. “how much is all of your assets minus your liabilities for everything you have?”)</em> This person should not be making economic claims, they’re not even on the right scale of understanding. That calls into question every other economic-flavored statement in the reading, such as the amount of money required to lift the poor out of poverty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(p2) “we continue as if it were absolutely normal that five trillion dollars are spent to save the banks and we did not bother to spend a cent to overcome poverty, discrimination, violence.” This is quite a distorted reading of the history of the crisis. There’s widespread debate still among economists about how to price the response to the financial system’s near-failure <em>(see also: <a href="">https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-much-the-financial-crisis-cost-51552690751</a> )</em>, but in any case saving the financial system was never about lifting the rest of the world out of poverty in the first place, and the notion that this is somehow an indictment of globalization in general needs much greater scrutiny than Ms. Chuji seems ready to wrestle with, given her lack of understanding of the relationship between GDP and net worth of a country.</p>
<p>I would take the rest of the reading as a political soapbox rather than the informed argument it’s posing as.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rights_of_Nature_in_Ecuador_-_Sumak_Kawsay">About “sumak kawsay” in Wikipedia</a> I did a quick reading to get some context on the phrase, this link was helpful. But the “let’s get back to the garden” aesthetic for living isn’t a new idea, it’s a reaction: to industrialism, to globalism, to modernism, to basically all of the negative side-effects that “progress” spins off, perhaps, amplified by anxieties about wealth inequality.</p>
<p><strong>(From Reading B)</strong> <em>(“Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”)</em></p>
<p>It seems like Mr. Cuestas-Caza is saying that the club of academics/intellectuals who are playing the “sumak kawsay card” in their critques of globalism, wealth inequality, and the oppression of the 3rd world by the 1st are committing the error of objectifying something they don’t really know first-hand: i.e. like they’re taking this mutable concept borrowed from tribal communities and overstating the degree to which they understand it by having lived it.</p>
<p>Because the language of the paper is so technical and arcane, it’s not entirely clear but that’s the gist of what I see in a quick scouring and reading the conclusion with more care than the rest of it.</p>
<p>In any case, if there was a room of conservatives fighting with liberals, it’s likely that someone on the conservative side would point out the hyperventiliating rhetoric of people like Monica Chuji, with her tenuous grasp of economics, as exemplary of “what’s wrong with liberalism in general.” Food would be thrown by both sides, naturally, and I assume that some of that food would be made out of sumak kawsay.</p>
