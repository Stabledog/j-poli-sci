<p>T 1/28 Sarah Maitland – <em>What is Cultural Translation</em>? Chapter 1 <strong>SJ 7</strong></p>
<p>“To qualify as cultural translation a phenomenon of human expression in the social sphere must be shown to engage in a contemplative work of understanding addressed towards a particular substance, but it must also have as its primary objective nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” p.53</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 2 of the book is titled “Translation and the Space-Time Continuum” suggesting various avenues for mocking the spiritual/psychobabble/too-much-LSD perspective of the author. Everybody thinks their topic is cosmic, right?</p></li>
<li><p>The given statement suggests the primary objective is “nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” Again… Ms. Maitland doesn’t want to be an academic, she wants to be a guru. She settled but it still itches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The statement is the closing remark of chapter 1, so there’s no need to connect it to the chapter conclusion, it’s already there: given the lofty role she grants to interpretation <em>(“hermeneutics” is used 83 times in the book, often framed in terms that suggest it’s the central thing to understand about humans)</em>. Consider this passage from the intro (p7):</p>
<div>
<pre><code>*Hermeneutics, as elaborated by Ricoeur, is the ‘art’ of interpretation that questions the limits of our interpretation, a form of understanding that is not simply a way of knowing or a method of analysis but an ontological imperative: to understand who we are and where we stand before the objectfor-interpretation.*</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Ironically, I almost sort-of agree with her perspective about the importance of human meaning-making. I’m mostly annoyed not by the central idea but with the art-house posturing of the language used in the book. She’s trying to hard to impress someone we’ve never met, the old 10,000-words-doing-the-work-of-1000.</p>

<p>R 1/30 Monica Chuji - “Modernity, development, interculturality and Sumak Kawsay or Living Well but not Better”; Javier Cuestas-Caza “Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir” <strong>SJ 8</strong></p>
<p>“I believe that interculturality must be put in a framework to find bridges in the transition between civilizactions. That is to say, interculturality must be the form by which we conserve the best of this system, to be journeying towards a new system that surpasses Capitalism and modernity in a definitive way. Seen this way, interculturality becomes one of the most convenient forms to overcome development and journey towards sumak kawsay.” Monica Chuji, p. 3</p>
