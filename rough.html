<p>R 1/23 The <em>Tao Te Ching</em> in 3 Versions</p>
<p>Choose and analyze an interesting difference between the three versions of the text we read.</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Version 1: Addiss &amp; Lombardo, p1-14</li>
<li>Version 2: Ursula K. Le Guin, p15-28</li>
<li>Version 3: D.C. Lau, p29-39</li>
</ul>
<p>Version 2 stands out for its liberal doses of Le Guin’s personal “insights” into the text, and its “common street vocabulary”: clearly she wants to make the famously cryptic text “accessible”, and could be accused of simply using it as a frame for her extensive philosophical footnotes.</p>
<p>I find a touch of hilarity on p17-18 (p4-5 relative) in which she states confidently that <em>“values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world. To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance. To let go of that belief is to find safety.”</em></p>
<p>Where’s the hilarity? Well… everything that follows “values and beliefs are culturally constructed” is itself a statement of values and beliefs that seem to be claiming status as transcendent truth. This could all be restated with less posturing and greater self-awareness: “All values and beliefs except mine are culturally constructed.”</p>
<p>The text is printed by Shambhala in Boulder, CO – famous mainly for their endless flooding of the market with “spiritual guidance” from exotic foreign authorities translated for Westerners who are “discovering the ancient truths.” So I bet this sold well.</p>
<p>Version 1 has no footnotes at all, as Addiss and Lombardo seem more conservative in believing that the reader is more interested in the translated text than their personal views of life and enlightenment. It’s also beautifully rendered, with ideograms presumably from the source decorating each page and a classic-poetry typography and indenting style, suggesting that the Tao transcends the words on the page perhaps.</p>
<p>The <em>Tao Te Ching</em> is full of contrasts and contradictions, trying always to push the reader off of their comfortable certainty into unfamiliar perspectives, and this version seems content to let that flow through the translation.</p>
<p>Version 3 eschews Le Guin’s personal narrative as well, but adds an apologetic tone: the footnotes point to the difficulty the translator had in finding the right phrases, e.g. <em>“The Chinese terms used here are not precise and it is not clear what the intended contrast is. The translation is, therefore, tentative.” (p6 relative)</em> It’s hard to imagine Le Guin admitting to such lack of confidence, and it’s a charming humility suggesting a workmanlike approach of the translator with an unglorified understanding of his own role: “try to make some sense of this in English and move on.”</p>

<h2 id="statement-1">Statement</h2>
<p>T 1/28 Sarah Maitland – <em>What is Cultural Translation</em>? Chapter 1 <strong>SJ 7</strong></p>
<p>“To qualify as cultural translation a phenomenon of human expression in the social sphere must be shown to engage in a contemplative work of understanding addressed towards a particular substance, but it must also have as its primary objective nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” p.53</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only-1">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter 2 of the book is titled “Translation and the Space-Time Continuum” suggesting various avenues for mocking the spiritual/psychobabble/too-much-LSD perspective of the author. Everybody thinks their topic is cosmic, right?</p></li>
<li><p>The given statement suggests the primary objective is “nothing short of the transformation of human hearts and minds.” Again… Ms. Maitland doesn’t want to be an academic, she wants to be a guru. She settled but it still itches.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The statement is the closing remark of chapter 1, so there’s no need to connect it to the chapter conclusion, it’s already there: given the lofty role she grants to interpretation <em>(“hermeneutics” is used 83 times in the book, often framed in terms that suggest it’s the central thing to understand about humans)</em>. Consider this passage from the intro (p7):</p>
<div>
<pre><code>*Hermeneutics, as elaborated by Ricoeur, is the ‘art’ of interpretation that questions the limits of our interpretation, a form of understanding that is not simply a way of knowing or a method of analysis but an ontological imperative: to understand who we are and where we stand before the objectfor-interpretation.*</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Ironically, I almost sort-of agree with her perspective about the importance of human meaning-making. I’m mostly annoyed not by the central idea but with the art-house posturing of the language used in the book. She’s trying to hard to impress someone we’ve never met, the old 10,000-words-doing-the-work-of-1000.</p>

<h2 id="statement-2">Statement</h2>
<p><strong>(Reading A)</strong> - “Modernity, development, interculturality and Sumak Kawsay or Living Well but not Better” &gt; R 1/30 Monica Chuji</p>
<p><strong>(Reading B)</strong> - Javier Cuestas-Caza “Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”</p>
<p>“I believe that interculturality must be put in a framework to find bridges in the transition between civilizations. That is to say, interculturality must be the form by which we conserve the best of this system, to be journeying towards a new system that surpasses Capitalism and modernity in a definitive way. Seen this way, interculturality becomes one of the most convenient forms to overcome development and journey towards sumak kawsay.” &gt; Monica Chuji, p. 3</p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>Ms. Chuji’s argument reminds me peripherally of Winston Churchill’s “democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others” – not because there’s a direct mapping to her advocacy of a utopia undefined, but more in the sense that if you’re going to discard the dominant framework for something better, you’re taking on the responsibility for demonstrating that the new world you see will indeed be better, and it’s a big responsibility.</p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and grant her complaints about the world as it is, after first forgiving the regrettable confusion she exhibits when framing the “5 trillion dollars” claimed as the cost of the U.S. financial system bailout as being “40% of the total wealth of the United States.” We must be forgiving because the statement is nonsense, but doesn’t go to the core of her argument: there’s nothing about $5T which makes it equal to “40% of the total wealth of the United States”: it appears that she mistook the 2007 US G.D.P of $13.86T for “total wealth”, which is a very different concept.</p>
<p>More forgiveness yet is needed: the total cost of the financial crisis seems an ongoing topic of ongoing debate among economists, who have yet to converge on agreement about how to value the benefits of the interventions – estimates range from a net positive gain to &gt; $30T, which is a wide enough span to leave an honest non-economist in doubt. But Ms. Chuji seems ready to set the benefits of the bailout at $0.</p>
<p>Then a bit more forgiveness is needed for her failure to acknowledge that the policy goals around bailing out the U.S. financial system were never about lifting the rest of the underdeveloped world out of poverty in the first place. She has taken a perspective which posits an imaginary all-seeing, all-powerful world government which can be attacked for its neglect of the modest needs of the poor in exchange for servicing the wealthy bankers, but no such entity exists to be slayed thereby.</p>
<p>Still, it is true that wealth inequality and the grindingly slow advance of the poor around the world are real problems with real consequences and needless suffering abounds. Even a wealthy banker can care about that, and plenty do. But Ms. Chuji is telling a story of the corruption of power, she’s named that demon “progress”, and cannot drift off message to grant any nuances for what progress might mean: “an act of cynicism and collusion with power” (p.2), “a system which decides to protect markets over the human beings who belong to it” (p.2), “the ideology of progress has been shown to be perverse”, etc.</p>
<p>As she draws the boundary between “us” and “them” by conjuring dark authorities who think and act in concert but lack a publicly-known name and address, who place pins on the global map in their smoke-filled rooms to choose winners and losers, who flip the knobs of capital so it flows into Manhattan instead of Ecuador, she narrates The Other into existence and explains the world’s problems in terms of the cabal’s nature and actions.</p>
<p>So now we know what’s wrong: “progress and power”. And the solution is what, exactly? “Buen vivir”? “Sumak kawsay”? A shift in social perspective which deprioritizes “egoism and individuality” (p.2) and brings forth the awakening of “a notion that wants to recover that harmonious relation between human beings and their surroundings.”</p>
<p>Ok: she has my vote. By all means, let’s press this button which causes humans to lose their egocentrism in favor of the rich utopia of harmony between humanity and nature. Let the sumak kawsay flow, let it flood the valley and lift the boats of serfs and bankers together. Who could argue against that?</p>
<p>If she can provide some additional specific instructions – preferably free of economic theory mistakes, one-sided historical narratives, and detail-free visions of utopia while simultaneously identifying the challenges to the production of this new world, that would be good. Because we simple good folks need that kind of guidance.</p>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p><strong>(From Reading A)</strong> – the “Modernity, development,…” reading contains fairly obvious errors</p>
<ul>
<li>e.g.:
<ul>
<li>“In these two year and a half years since the outbreak”: <em>(some sort of typo, possibly due to translation from Spanish)</em></li>
<li>“In 2007 the (GNP) of the United States was $13.86T. … the financial markets were allocated 40% of the amount of total wealth in the US.” <em>(This is completely wrong: the gross national product has nothing to do with the “total wealth” of a country. It’s the difference between “how much value did you create this year?” vs. “how much is all of your assets minus your liabilities for everything you have?”)</em> This person should not be making economic claims, they’re not even on the right scale of understanding. That calls into question every other economic-flavored statement in the reading, such as the amount of money required to lift the poor out of poverty.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>(p2) “we continue as if it were absolutely normal that five trillion dollars are spent to save the banks and we did not bother to spend a cent to overcome poverty, discrimination, violence.” This is quite a distorted reading of the history of the crisis. There’s widespread debate still among economists about how to price the response to the financial system’s near-failure <em>(see also: <a href="">https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-much-the-financial-crisis-cost-51552690751</a> )</em>, but in any case saving the financial system was never about lifting the rest of the world out of poverty in the first place, and the notion that this is somehow an indictment of globalization in general needs much greater scrutiny than Ms. Chuji seems ready to wrestle with, given her lack of understanding of the relationship between GDP and net worth of a country.</p>
<p>I would take the rest of the reading as a political soapbox rather than the informed argument it’s posing as.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rights_of_Nature_in_Ecuador_-_Sumak_Kawsay">About “sumak kawsay” in Wikipedia</a> I did a quick reading to get some context on the phrase, this link was helpful. But the “let’s get back to the garden” aesthetic for living isn’t a new idea, it’s a reaction: to industrialism, to globalism, to modernism, to basically all of the negative side-effects that “progress” spins off, perhaps, amplified by anxieties about wealth inequality.</p>
<p><strong>(From Reading B)</strong> <em>(“Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”)</em></p>
<p>It seems like Mr. Cuestas-Caza is saying that the club of academics/intellectuals who are playing the “sumak kawsay card” in their critques of globalism, wealth inequality, and the oppression of the 3rd world by the 1st are committing the error of objectifying something they don’t really know first-hand: i.e. like they’re taking this mutable concept borrowed from tribal communities and overstating the degree to which they understand it by having lived it.</p>
<p>Because the language of the paper is so technical and arcane, it’s not entirely clear but that’s the gist of what I see in a quick scouring and reading the conclusion with more care than the rest of it.</p>
<p>In any case, if there was a room of conservatives fighting with liberals, it’s likely that someone on the conservative side would point out the hyperventiliating rhetoric of people like Monica Chuji, with her tenuous grasp of economics, as exemplary of “what’s wrong with liberalism in general.” Food would be thrown by both sides, naturally, and I assume that some of that food would be made out of sumak kawsay.</p>

<h2 id="statement-3">Statement</h2>
<p>T 2/4 Minako O’Hanagan – Transcreating Japanese Video Games (<em>Translation and Translation Studies in Japan</em>, Chapter 10).</p>
<p>Industry insiders generally agree that without Japanese contributions the game sector would not have gone beyond “a passing fad” (Aoyama and Izushi 2003: 424). Commenting on the power shift in the video game industry from the United States to Japan, Consalvo (2006: 132) cautiously remarks that the flow of cultural dominance for consoles and many major games is currently in the direction from East to West, “with Japan leading production, the USA and Europe following.”</p>
<h2 id="response-notes-only-2">Response (notes only)</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Sort of baffled by the inclusion of this statement about the “flow of cultural dominance for … games”. It sounds like commentary on market movements having little to do with translation studies, and doesn’t express a central theme of the chapter.</p></li>
<li><p>The point of the chapter is really that “transcreation” breaks the wall between translation and creation: the localization process of a Japanese game which makes it appropriate to a foreign target market involves more than mere translation of text meanings into other languages. This gives the “transcreator” a role in the creative process that they are normally denied… they’re no longer obliged to be a transparent window from one culture to another, they need to deal with questions which affect the player’s enjoyment of the product, which has culturally-bound aspects.</p></li>
<li><p>Some interesting tidbits from the chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the term translation in its narrow sense of converting verbal messages in one language into another, while localization refers to the broader process of “taking a product and making it linguistically and culturally appropriate to the target locale (country/region and language)” p.186</p></li>
<li><p>While sharing localization elements that are common with other software products, such as translation of the user interface (UI), games require the translation of many different types of in-game text, including more literary as well as functional and technical text. The cinematics that are now regularly inserted in games also require translation in a form similar to subtitling and/or revoicing. p.187</p></li>
</ul></li>
