<p>T 2/18 Karatani Kojin – <em>The Origins of Modern Japanese Literature</em>, Ch. 2</p>
<p>The theme of the exploration of the modern self, however diverse its articulations, dominates discussions of modern Japanese literature. Yet it is laughable to speak of this modern self as if it were purely a mental or psychological phenomenon. For this modern self is rooted in materiality and comes into existence-if I may put it this way-only by being established as a system. What I want to emphasize is the systematicity of the very “inner self” that is usually seen as challenging systems. <em>(p.61)</em></p>
<h2 id="response">Response</h2>
<p>I read Kojin’s goal – the desire to illustrate “the systematicity of the very ‘inner self’ that is usually seen as challenging systems” – as a clear-enough statement of what “The Discovery of Interiority” is supposed to achieve. In other words, we expect the text to contain arguments and evidence which support the idea that our “interiority” of subjective thinking, experience, and feeling to which we commonly affix the label “my self” is itself a kind of system rather than a fundamental existence of a thing-that-is-the-self which views other systems as mere constructions.</p>
<p>Expecting Kojin to puncture the view of the unitary self as subject, as the starting point for navigation of experience, I instead find myself lost in the text, unable to connect the themes in the chapter with the stated goal even a little bit.</p>
<p>It’s not that he writes poorly: there’s plenty of interesting thought-food present. He bounces between east and west with an admirable freedom, but for one deprived of knowledge of the Japanese language and the entire context of literary culture and history in Japanese, if his argument depends on connecting dots in those references it might was well be written in Martian. It’s simply not evident how the primary thesis is being connected into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>The conclusion should surely tie a bow onto the author’s intentions, but if so it’s an invisible ribbon af apparently unrelated thoughts:</p>
<p><em>“As Paul Valery observed, the person who discovers a new way of looking at a single phenomenon will immediately discover a host of other phenomena. Edgar Allen Poe took the basic form of the detective story to its limits, yet it was his bold experiment in exploring the consciousness of poetic composition, not crime, that constituted his advance. The multiplicity of Doppo has nothing to do with which literary school he belonged to, but results from his having been the first Japanese writer to attain”transparency."</em> (p.72)</p>
<p>I hope I can be forgiven for not understanding how this paragraph is a conclusion of any kind, let alone a conclusion which comprises the third segment of “tell us what you’re going to say, then say it, then tell us what you said.”</p>
<p>There’s nothing novel about a student lamenting the incomprehensibility of a reading assignment, presumably. Only if the logic of the lesson is in Japanese, inaccessible to the non-Japanese reader, then the English portion of the material isn’t the frame, it’s perhaps window dressing at best. It does seem like the frame remains hidden here.</p>
