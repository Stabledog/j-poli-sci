## Statement
R 1/30 Monica Chuji
A- “Modernity, development, interculturality and Sumak Kawsay or Living Well but not Better”
B- Javier Cuestas-Caza “Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”

“I believe that interculturality must be put in a framework to find bridges in the transition between civilizations. That is to say, interculturality must be the form by which we conserve the best of this system, to be journeying towards a new system that surpasses Capitalism and modernity in a definitive way. Seen this way, interculturality becomes one of the most convenient forms to overcome development and journey towards sumak kawsay.” Monica Chuji, p. 3

## Response (notes only)

(A) -- the "Modernity, development,..." reading contains fairly obvious errors, e.g.:
- "In these two year and a half years since the outbreak": *(some sort of typo, possibly due to translation from Spanish)*
- "In 2007 the (GNP) of the United States was $13.86T. ... the financial markets were allocated 40% of the amount of total wealth in the US."  *(This is completely wrong: the gross national product has nothing to do with the "total wealth" of a country.  It's the difference between "how much value did you create this year?" vs. "how much is all of your assets minus your liabilities for everything you have?")*  This person should not be making economic claims, they're not even on the right scale of understanding.  That calls into question every other economic-flavored statement in the reading, such as the amount of money required to lift the poor out of poverty.

(p2) "we continue as if it were absolutely normal that five trillion dollars are spent to save the banks and we did not bother to spend a cent to overcome poverty, discrimination, violence."  This is quite a distorted reading of the history of the crisis.
