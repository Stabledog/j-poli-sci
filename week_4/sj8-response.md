## Statement

**(Reading A)** - “Modernity, development, interculturality and Sumak Kawsay or Living Well but not Better” > R 1/30 Monica Chuji

**(Reading B)** - Javier Cuestas-Caza “Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir”

“I believe that interculturality must be put in a framework to find bridges in the transition between civilizations. That is to say, interculturality must be the form by which we conserve the best of this system, to be journeying towards a new system that surpasses Capitalism and modernity in a definitive way. Seen this way, interculturality becomes one of the most convenient forms to overcome development and journey towards sumak kawsay.”
> Monica Chuji, p. 3

## Response (notes only)

**(From Reading A)** -- the "Modernity, development,..." reading contains fairly obvious errors

- e.g.:
    - "In these two year and a half years since the outbreak": *(some sort of typo, possibly due to translation from Spanish)*
    - "In 2007 the (GNP) of the United States was $13.86T. ... the financial markets were allocated 40% of the amount of total wealth in the US."  *(This is completely wrong: the gross national product has nothing to do with the "total wealth" of a country.  It's the difference between "how much value did you create this year?" vs. "how much is all of your assets minus your liabilities for everything you have?")*  This person should not be making economic claims, they're not even on the right scale of understanding.  That calls into question every other economic-flavored statement in the reading, such as the amount of money required to lift the poor out of poverty.

(p2) "we continue as if it were absolutely normal that five trillion dollars are spent to save the banks and we did not bother to spend a cent to overcome poverty, discrimination, violence."  This is quite a distorted reading of the history of the crisis.  There's widespread debate still among economists about how to price the response to the financial system's near-failure *(see also: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-much-the-financial-crisis-cost-51552690751]() )*, but in any case saving the financial system was never about lifting the rest of the world out of poverty in the first place, and the notion that this is somehow an indictment of globalization in general needs much greater scrutiny than Ms. Chuji seems ready to wrestle with, given her lack of understanding of the relationship between GDP and net worth of a country.

I would take the rest of the reading as a political soapbox rather than the informed argument it's posing as.

[About "sumak kawsay" in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rights_of_Nature_in_Ecuador_-_Sumak_Kawsay) I did a quick reading to get some context on the phrase, this link was helpful.   But the "let's get back to the garden" aesthetic for living isn't a new idea, it's a reaction: to industrialism, to globalism, to modernism, to basically all of the negative side-effects that "progress" spins off, perhaps, amplified by anxieties about wealth inequality.


**(From Reading B)**  *("Sumak Kawsay is not Buen Vivir")*

It seems like Mr. Cuestas-Caza is saying that the club of academics/intellectuals who are playing the "sumak kawsay card" in their critques of globalism, wealth inequality, and the oppression of the 3rd world by the 1st are committing the error of objectifying something they don't really know first-hand: i.e. like they're taking this mutable concept borrowed from tribal communities and overstating the degree to which they understand it by having lived it.

Because the language of the paper is so technical and arcane, it's not entirely clear but that's the gist of what I see in a quick scouring and reading the conclusion with more care than the rest of it.

In any case, if there was a room of conservatives fighting with liberals, it's likely that someone on the conservative side would point out the hyperventiliating rhetoric of people like Monica Chuji, with her tenuous grasp of economics, as exemplary of "what's wrong with liberalism in general."  Food would be thrown by both sides, naturally, and I assume that some of that food would be made out of sumak kawsay.
