### SJ1 *(Munday - "A Translation Studies Perspective")

#### In response to:
```
The specification of the translation environment is certainly
complex. The wide range of extra-textual factors, including the socio-cultural, political and ideological (in its wide cognitive sense of “a special type of socially shared mental representations”), are far from easy to differentiate…”
p.43

Munday has a point: translation is an inherently complex activity, and the naive idea that there's a literal one-to-one correspondence between source terms and a unique and unambiguous "equivalent" expression" in another language can be safely dismissed.  This activity is hard: the meaning of any utterance can be challenging to derive even without crossing a language boundary -- the difficulty of communication between identical twins raised in the same family might be charted as a function of the subtlety of the message, but the less twin-like the parties become, the more the complications multiply and content quickly weighs less than context in telling the story of the problem faced by translators.

How do we even identify the categories of factors that affect the quality of a translation?  He mentions "socio-cultural, political, and ideological" differences but these are vast generalities -- a finer-grained enumeration of what those terms mean specifically in any given situation would itself be a long job.

It's also worth noting that those kinds of influencing factors do not address an even more fundamental kind of difference:  does the target audience even have the distinctions that would allow the concepts to be represented?  As a crude example, imagine a nuclear physicist tasked with explaining the math surrounding the Higgs boson to an Amazonian tribe who possess 200 words for discussing vines collected in the forest.

The audience has no concept of atoms, let alone subatomic particles or quantum mechanics or integrals and differentials.  The translator for this dialog is obliged to build an entire model of modern science and mathematics and install it before trying to map the physicist's statements into the destination tongue.  The symbols in the source have no corresponding equivalents, and the "cost of translation" is dominated by the need to reconcile wildly different perspectives about what exists and how things are related to each other.

If the target context is deficient of the distinctions that compose the message, is the translator justified in throwing up their hands in frustration?  Is it fair to define translation as including the reconciliation of vastly different worlds so that communication can occur?

Then returning to the social and political focus of Munday's essay, one cannot dispute that the translator's "agenda" stands tall among the quality-endangering forces:  when Donald Trump says "it was a perfect phone call", we're being treated to a representation of events which is so thoroughly bathed in the speaker's goals that it barely counts as a form of communication at all. Munday's list of agenda-driven translation stories does a fair job of outlining some of the ways that translators become less than perfect mirrors when their goals or functional constraints bend the beam in unspoken ways.
