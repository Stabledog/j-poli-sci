### The statement is **SJ 2**:
“To speak of untranslatables in no way implies that the terms in question, or the expressions, the syntactical or grammatical turns, are not and cannot be translated: the untranslatable is rather what one keeps on (not) translating. But this indicates that their translation, into one language or another, creates a problem, to the extent of sometimes generating a neologism or imposing a new meaning on an old word. It is a sign of the way in which, from one language to another, neither the words nor the conceptual networks can simply be superimposed.” p.xvii

### Re: Barbara Cassin's intro to her book (xvii-xx)
She distinguishes the perspective of the book from 2 positions:

### [a]- A "logical universalism indifferent to languages" (with "English as the auxiliary international language")

### [b] - An "ontological nationalism essentializing the spirit of languages" e.g. Herder,Heidegger, Lefebvre, who seem to think German special for philosophy and or translation, as well as the "sacralization" of language and the untranslatable.

She quotes Heidegger as saying "Heidegger thinks that Western thought... only in German... rises to the level of Greek (for philosophy) and 'untranslatability finally becomes the criterion of truth'" (Lefebvre)

### [c] -

-  Instead of [a] or [b], the Dictionary of Untranslatables is doing a "Deleuzian deterritorialization" -- the semantic network vs. the isolated concept.

- "There is no concept without the word" (p.xx)  Oh really?  Not so.  This oversimplifies.  Distinctions and concepts are both descriptive and constructive in their relationship with human experience: we lose something in description, and we gain something in construction.  When a new distinction emerges, we see what we didn't see before.  When we try to encode our experience in language, we forever feel that we've lost its essence somewhere in the process.

## Re: "To Translate" (1139-1151)
- Dubious repetition of the idea that "One needs at least two languages in order to translate."  Indeed an ordinary dictionary is simply an enumeration of translations from a symbol to its network of meanings, all of that happens without crossing a language boundary.  Translation is better understood as "the mapping of meaning from one domain to another", and inter-language translation is a subset of that concept.

## Giles Deleuze (French philosopher 20th century, "Difference and Repetition")
His work sounds resonant with 1pp: https://youtu.be/AUQTYlCTfek, particularly noteworth is "The Virtual" which refers to the set of conditions which arise from the relations between differences, allowing possibilities to arise but constraining them from absurd randomness.

## Michael Kunnucan (discovered on google reviewing "Dictionary of Untranslatables"):
[Interesting review of "Dictionary of Translatables"](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/criticism/barbara-cassin-dictionary-of-untranslatables-a-philosophical-lexicon/)

Philosophy works on the premise that the words we use hide unsuspected implications and ambiguities, refer to entities whose nature we are by no means sure of, involve us in problems we can't solve, ask questions to which we do not necessarily have any answers; a philosopher begins by hearing his native language as a foreign tongue. The famous "homesickness" of the philosopher (per Hölderlin) is sometimes just that: nostalgia for an unproblematic relationship with the way words mean.

 Philosophy in this sense is a kind of autotranslation, translation out of and into one's native tongue.
 *(New term: "philosophical autotranslation" - Michael Kinnucan)*

Heideggerian word-mysticism (according to which "untranslatability is the criterion of truth")
