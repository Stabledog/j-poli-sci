# Week 1 - Cassin

## Re: Barbara Cassin's intro to her book (xvii-xx)
She distinguishes the perspective of the book from 2 positions:
- "English as the auxiliary international language"
- The "ontological nationalism" of Herder,Heidegger, Lefebvre, who seem to think German special for philosophy and or translation, as well as the "sacralization" of language and the untranslatable.

She quotes Heidegger as saying "Heidegger thinks that Western thought... only in German... rises to the level of Greek (for philosophy) and 'untranslatability finally becomes the criterion of truth'" (Lefebvre)

## Michael Kunnucan (discovered on google reviewing "Dictionary of Untranslatables"):
[Interesting review of "Dictionary of Translatables"](https://www.asymptotejournal.com/criticism/barbara-cassin-dictionary-of-untranslatables-a-philosophical-lexicon/)

Philosophy works on the premise that the words we use hide unsuspected implications and ambiguities, refer to entities whose nature we are by no means sure of, involve us in problems we can't solve, ask questions to which we do not necessarily have any answers; a philosopher begins by hearing his native language as a foreign tongue. The famous "homesickness" of the philosopher (per HÃ¶lderlin) is sometimes just that: nostalgia for an unproblematic relationship with the way words mean.

 Philosophy in this sense is a kind of autotranslation, translation out of and into one's native tongue.
 *(New term: "philosophical autotranslation" - Michael Kinnucan)*

Heideggerian word-mysticism (according to which "untranslatability is the criterion of truth")
