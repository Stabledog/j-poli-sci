<p><em>“To speak of 'untranslatables' in no way implies that the terms in question, or the expressions, the syntactical or grammatical turns, are not and cannot be translated: the untranslatable is rather what one keeps on (not) translating. But this indicates that their translation, into one language or another, creates a problem, to the extent of sometimes generating a neologism or imposing a new meaning on an old word. It is a sign of the way in which, from one language to another, neither the words nor the conceptual networks can simply be superimposed.” <strong>p.xvii</strong></em></p>

<p>While it's tempting to challenge Ms. Cassin's introduction to her massive volume on the basis that it's foreshadowing the subsequent reading material by pursuing the most verbose and contorted way to say what might otherwise be made readily accessible to ordinary readers, we should possibly consider the moral development value of resisting the temptation to satirize the Introduction as &quot;2000 words doing the work of 500&quot; and avoid launching a story about academic tomes that are sold by weight instead of value. Additionally, such an approach carries risk: I can't promise that the gist of all 2000 words of the introduction were clearly understood, let alone the densely packed 12 pages following, and in any case the whole volume was itself translated from French to English, so might not some of the critique be owed to the translator? Out of my league and lacking the confidence to fling darts at the Mona Lisa for failing to smile properly, I'll settle for commenting on the frame of the painting.</p>
<p>A candidate reduction of the given statement <em>(yes, Virginia, some things really are given!)</em> is &quot;stuff gets lost in translation, and that can make problems. You can't just think you're speed-matching equal groups of boys and girls for dance class.&quot;</p>
<p>Ms. Cassin's use of &quot;creates a problem&quot; to characterize untranslatability suggests a value system yet to be revealed which outlines the quality metrics for the results of translating -- as if we all know already what we're trying to achieve, and if we fail at that we say that we &quot;untranslated&quot;, and the result is a problem of some kind. And yet, much of the material in the reading suggests that the distinctions which qualify success in translation are still subject to debate. If we don't know what &quot;good&quot; means, how upset should we be about our score?</p>
<p>To the common mind, the goal of translation is &quot;simple fidelity&quot;: an equivalence of meaning when the content comes out of the pipe. But we're here to challenge that kind of simplicity, of course: to think more deeply about the source, the destination, the process, the results, and the goals. Is &quot;equivalence of meaning&quot; universally meaningful, achievable, or valuable? Are there not contexts where that goal is itself a problem? If you revive West Side Story and turn the Jets and Sharks into bond traders and SEC regulators respectively, have you done damage or enriched the legacy of Romeo and Juliet?</p>
<p>On the other hand, clearly there are contexts where simple fidelity counts: we want the Owner's Manual for the 737 Max to clearly explain how the system &quot;helps&quot; the pilot control the plane, and success in translation is measurable in lives not lost.</p>
<p>In short, if we're going to have an opinion here and challenge something, the opposing army is the notion that &quot;translation&quot; refers to a singular kind of activity that can itself be defined unambiguously: a utility which is distributed throughout the city for a well-understood and common purpose valued by all. I think it more appropriate to consider &quot;translation&quot; as a whole collection of somewhat-related games -- a category whose boundaries are forever and justifiably in dispute. Sometimes we want to play variations on a theme by Shakespeare, and sometimes we want to fly without hitting the ground with the wrong part of the plane.</p>
<p>In short, if we're going to talk a lot about &quot;translation&quot; and what gets lost or added or distorted, we should recognize that the meaning of this idea depends on context too: what are we trying to achieve? We need to consider that before we can say what might constitute a problem in any particular outcome.</p>
