## Statement
R 1/23 The *Tao Te Ching* in 3 Versions

Choose and analyze an interesting difference between the three versions of the text we read.

## Response (notes only)

- Version 1: Addiss & Lombardo, p1-14
- Version 2: Ursula K. Le Guin, p15-28
- Version 3: D.C. Lau, p29-39

Version 2 stands out for its liberal doses of Le Guin's personal "insights" into the text, and its "common street vocabulary": clearly she wants to make the famously cryptic text "accessible", and could be accused of simply using it as a frame for her extensive philosophical footnotes.

I find a touch of hilarity on p17-18 (p4-5 relative) in which she states confidently that *"values and beliefs are not only culturally constructed but also part of the interplay of yin and yang, the great reversals that maintain the living balance of the world.  To believe that our beliefs are permanent truths which encompass reality is a sad arrogance.  To let go of that belief is to find safety."*

Where's the hilarity?  Well... everything that follows "values and beliefs are culturally constructed" is itself a statement of values and beliefs that seem to be claiming status as transcendent truth.  This could all be restated with less posturing and greater self-awareness:  "All values and beliefs except mine are culturally constructed."

The text is printed by Shambhala in Boulder, CO -- famous mainly for their endless flooding of the market with "spiritual guidance" from exotic foreign authorities translated for Westerners who are "discovering the ancient truths."  So I bet this sold well.

Version 1 has no footnotes at all, as Addiss and Lombardo seem more conservative in believing that the reader is more interested in the translated text than their personal views of life and enlightenment.  It's also beautifully rendered, with ideograms presumably from the source decorating each page and a classic-poetry typography and indenting style, suggesting that the Tao transcends the words on the page perhaps.

The *Tao Te Ching* is full of contrasts and contradictions, trying always to push the reader off of their comfortable certainty into unfamiliar perspectives, and this version seems content to let that flow through the translation.

Version 3 eschews Le Guin's personal narrative as well, but adds an apologetic tone: the footnotes point to the difficulty the translator had in finding the right phrases, e.g. *"The Chinese terms used here are not precise and it is not clear what the intended contrast is.  The translation is, therefore, tentative." (p6 relative)*  It's hard to imagine Le Guin admitting to such lack of confidence, and it's a charming humility suggesting a workmanlike approach of the translator with an unglorified understanding of his own role:  "try to make some sense of this in English and move on."
