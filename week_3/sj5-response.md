## Statement

T 1/21 Walter Benjamin – “The Task of The Translator”

“Translation is so far removed from being the sterile equation of two dead languages that of all literary forms it is the one charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process of the original language and the birth pangs of its own.” p.256


## Response (notes only)

- "far removed from ... the sterile equation of two dead languages" is hard to argue with, unless we're talking about Ikea assembly instructions, which are always dead simple except for the 22 pages of language-specific hazard warnings, all of which say exactly the same thing:  "don't be an idiot."

- "... it is charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process... and the birth pangs...":  again, these folks could never be accused of not taking themselves seriously enough or treating translation as less than God's own favorite activity.

- I might slip in a comment about how the significance of the translator's role ought to have least some relationship to the significance of the work being translated.  Translating the McDonalds Kid's Menu into Greek should not require one to touch the top of Mount Olympus with their tongue and carry the nectar back as a gift for mere mortals.


- [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin#Writing_style) says "(Benjamin) posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth."
