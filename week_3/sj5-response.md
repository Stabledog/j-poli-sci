## Statement

T 1/21 Walter Benjamin – “The Task of The Translator”

“Translation is so far removed from being the sterile equation of two dead languages that of all literary forms it is the one charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process of the original language and the birth pangs of its own.” p.256


## Response (notes below)

The given statement is one of the more comprehensible utterances in Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator": it's clear to say that "the sterile equation of two dead languages" is an inadequate framework in which to understand the art of translation, but we might beg forgiveness for shifting uncomfortably when a guest -- after two glasses of wine -- claims for themselves "the special mission of watching over the maturing process of the original language and the birth pangs of" another.  But at least we'd be in the comfortable situation of understanding what they've said *(while re-corking the bottle, perhaps.)*

But this claim is mild in comparison to the grand vistas to come later.  Benjamin clearly strives to stretch the meaning of "translation" as far as is possible, until it encompasses totality in its all-seeing cosmic love.  Let's visit p.261 for example:

*"To relieve it of this, to turn the symbolizing into the symbolized itself, to regain pure language fully formed from the linguistic flux, is the **tremendous and only capacity of translation**. In this pure language-which no longer means or expresses anything but is, as expressionless and creative Word, that which is meant in all languages-all information, all sense, and all intention finally encounter a stratum in which they are destined to be extinguished."*

Here we see that taking away the wine didn't help: the "pure language" is something that I imagine we can only understand fleetingly as Mr. Benjamin is speaking directly to us from his most perfect posture, when the breath of the Big Bang wafts across our consciousness long enough to hear the echoes of "Let There Be Light" in the background radiation of the universe. Should we blink or relax our attention even momentarily, the pure language is lost, not to be rediscovered without another twenty years of spiritual struggle.

I thought it was just me -- too dimwitted to grasp the maze-like phrasing of Walter's writings -- until I encountered [this paraphrase from Susan Sontag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin#Writing_style):  *"in Benjamin's writing, sentences did not originate ordinarily, do not progress into one another, and delineate no obvious line of reasoning, as if each sentence 'had to say everything, before the inward gaze of total concentration dissolved the subject before his eyes', a 'freeze-frame baroque' style of writing and cogitation. 'His major essays seem to end just in time, before they self-destruct.'*

Not wishing to be dismissive of greatness, yet unable to scale the stairway to heaven to an altitude sufficient to see his viewpoint clearly, I yet feel as though Mr. Benjamin may be exploiting ambiguities in the common meaning of "translate", using the squishy bits of its definition to build a church that worships his spiritual beliefs.  If translation is just another way for God to express Himself, then the task of the translator is to channel the Almighty's thoughts?  The translator should first become one with the infinite, from which throne they can simply start typing and the result will perfect the source text into a form that the original author could never have hoped to produce?

If that's what "translation" means, I think I need some wine.

## Notes

- "far removed from ... the sterile equation of two dead languages" is hard to argue with, unless we're talking about Ikea assembly instructions, which are always dead simple except for the 22 pages of language-specific hazard warnings, all of which say exactly the same thing:  "don't be an idiot."

- "... it is charged with the special mission of watching over the maturing process... and the birth pangs...":  again, these folks could never be accused of not taking themselves seriously enough or treating translation as less than God's own favorite activity.

- I might slip in a comment about how the significance of the translator's role ought to have least some relationship to the significance of the work being translated.  Translating the McDonalds Kid's Menu into Greek should not require one to touch the top of Mount Olympus with their tongue and carry the nectar back as a gift for mere mortals.

- [Stanford Encyclopedia of Education](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/benjamin/) pegs Benjamin as trying to push back against nihilism and the deconstruction of modernity, holding mystical Judaism / Kabbalah as an expression of the spiritual.  Seems he always wants to see the whole reflected in each thing, which accounts for his seeming inability to say something that has tangible boundaries of distinction.

- [Wikipedia says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin#Writing_style) says "(Benjamin) posits that a literary translation, by definition, produces deformations and misunderstandings of the original text. Moreover, in the deformed text, otherwise hidden aspects of the original, source-language text are elucidated, while previously obvious aspects become unreadable. Such translational modification of the source text is productive; when placed in a specific constellation of works and ideas, newly revealed affinities, between historical objects, appear and are productive of philosophical truth."
