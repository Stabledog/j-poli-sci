<h3 id="sj-3-statement">SJ 3 Statement:</h3>
<p>“The dominance of transparency in English-language translation reflects comparable trends in other cultural forms, including other forms of writing. The enormous economic and political power acquired by scientific research during the twentieth century, the postwar innovations in advanced communications technologies to expand the advertising and entertainment industries and support the economic cycle of commodity production and exchange—these developments have affected every medium, both print and electronic, by valorizing a purely instrumental use of language and other means of representation and thus emphasizing immediate intelligibility and the appearance of factuality.” (p5, T 1/14 Lawrence Venuti – <em>The Translator’s Invisibility</em>, Chapter 1</p>
<h3 id="response">Response:</h3>
<p>Venuti closes with “The ultimate aim …is to force (reflection upon) the ethnocentric violence of translation and hence to write and read translated texts in ways that seek to recognize the linguistic and cultural difference of foreign texts.” Those who never tire of spotting irony in a crowd could raise eyebrows at the relationship between the use of “force” in the book’s mission statement with the “ethnocentric violence” the author indicts his targets with. Perhaps it takes force to fight force? I wouldn’t know. But on the day when we succeed in compelling others to do what we call “right” surely Paradise will take us into its arms, as every Disney princess knows. Does Mr. Venuti know?</p>
<p>We’re granting that he has a point, nevertheless: translators surely have agendas and biases,and weaknesses and blinds spots in abundance. To illustrate, he scolds Robert Graves’ “The Twelve Caesars” mentions of the remappings of city names, years, and currency values (p29) from the Latin source to target English cultural context as tactics to minimize the reader’s friction – which successfully “Penguin Classicize” the content – a forgivable albeit distorting force – but then Venuti finds tougher meat in exposing Graves’ edition as adding a homophobic twist to the tale of Caesar’s dealings with King Nicomedes (p32) in which Graves’ modern post-war fear of homosexuality colors the translation, imposing a narrative of “sexual perversion” (p34) not present in the Latin text.</p>
<p>Humans being natural storytellers who inevitably evolve the tale as it passes their lips, adding novel background colors and foreground figures to the tale, it’s understandable that we can expect the same in translation – a context where the translator is granted special status as a portal between cultures, rather than being held as just one of many local sources for a shared narrative who might be checked for fidelity against her peers. So the translator could arguably be held to a higher standard of fidelity associated with their distinctive role as facilitating the transfer of knowledge from one context to another.</p>
<p>But to make that argument, we’re once again thrown back into the soup of viewpoints: without first choosing a value framework that answers “what should translation be achieving?”, one lacks a basis to scold the translator. Does Graves have a right to earn a living by reweaving the tale in ways that mollify his modern readers but distort the history? Should we simply demand that the preface advertise the translators biases? Is the translator even aware of his biases?</p>
<p>A shared set of values underlies any movement that’s going to change the order of things. Venuti’s mission reflects the values of a modern academic-flavored universal liberalism: a podium from which he takes translators to task for their misdeeds. He is, in effect, telling us a story about the stories they’ve mistold due to their unexamined or unacknowledged biases. It’s hard to see how he can escape that judgment himself: we all see through the frame we bring with us, it’s just being human. We can surely acknowledge the effects of our frames without being called to punish or correct continually.</p>
