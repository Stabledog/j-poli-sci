<blockquote>
<p>R 1/16 Richard Burton – Selections from <em>The Arabian Nights</em>; D.S. Richards – “One Thousand and One Nights – A History of the Text and Its Reception.” <em>(Note: the selection description is inaccurate: the author of this piece (p270-291) is neither Richard Burton nor D.S. Richards, it’s Dwight F. Reynolds)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thus an accurate portrayal of the <em>Nights</em> in pre-modern Arabic literature must situate it within the rather fluid stratum of popular fictional literary production and as a work that was in many ways undifferentiated from a large body of similar texts. Many of these popular narratives and collections were compiled and copied not for personal, silent reading, but rather to function as the basis for public story-telling performances…. It would therefore be singularly inappropriate to approach a work drawn from this domain of popular medieval literature with preconceptions derived from the modern Western idea of a bounded, cohesive ‘text’ produced to be silently consumed by solitary readers.” p.273</p>
<h3 id="response">Response:</h3>
<p>Mr. Reynolds tells a tale that reads like the detailed description of the root system for an invasive species of vines, and the circuits are long and convoluted in time, geography, context, and motive. While trying to focus on the tracings he provides from step one to steps far in excess of the number of nights in the story, one could be forgiven for drifting off: it’s hard to sustain attention after a while, as each branch bounces off to another half-dozen branches, and half of those will eventually feed back into the branch we left two pages ago.</p>
<p>Indeed some sort of full-wall map of the causes-and-effects which serve as the Amazon-scale network that describes the ancestry of One Thousand and One Nights is called for. Thus it’s difficult to avoid the concern that any attempt to wrap a summarizing thesis around this monster which tells us what it all means about the discipline of translation in general is likely to be an exercise in the random selection of perspective: “pick a view, any view – and don’t show it to me until the last page.” Like a wandering magician in an Italian restaurant, Mr. Reynolds plays a trick that somehow has stacked the deck, such that the conclusion appearing in its coherent and unifying glory on p.291 seems utterly non-obvious to this poor diner slurping his spaghetti: “… Westerners for generations measured the physical reality of the Middle East against what was for them the ‘real’ East, the East of <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>. Certainly no other literary text can claim such a central role in reflecting, over several centuries, the changing relations between two great civilizations.”</p>
<p>That’s a pretty sweeping conclusion. Did not see that one coming… what with my attention being led through a complex labyrinth of feedback loops and errant branches and tales-within-tales about tales that never were or were reworked from other tales. How did we get to this “…central role in reflecting… the changing relations between two great civilizations”, let alone the superlatives which identify this as the defining dynamic between the West and East?</p>
<p>Perhaps I’m too trained by the Western tradition of deriving conclusions from facts and rules that are applied to facts to grant the Rorschach-reading of this network that Reynolds bestows upon it. To me, it’s not a story about a book, it’s a whole ecosystem of stories about stories about stories, whose only unifying thread is that in some way they can be connected to this phrase: <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>. But each of those connections is its own story: what mandates that they add up to this or any other conclusion?</p>
<p>Well it’s all in the eye of the beholder, I suppose. When the beholder is tasked with writing a conclusion, they rise to the occasion – demonstrating the power of storytelling once again. On night One Thousand and Two.</p>
