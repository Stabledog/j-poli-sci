### SJ 3 Statement:

** T 1/14 Lawrence Venuti – *The Translator’s Invisibility*, Chapter 1 **SJ
3**

“The dominance of transparency in English-language translation reflects comparable trends in other cultural forms, including other forms of writing. The enormous economic and political power acquired by scientific research during the twentieth century, the postwar innovations in advanced communications technologies to expand the advertising and entertainment industries and support the economic cycle of commodity production and exchange—these developments have affected every medium, both print and electronic, by valorizing a purely instrumental use of language and other means of representation and thus emphasizing immediate intelligibility and the appearance of factuality.”
p.5

- p5 He's making  good point: it's as if the translator is aiming the translation to slide without friction into an existing frame of reference, and this is taken for fidelity.

### SJ 4 Statement:

> R 1/16 Richard Burton – Selections from *The Arabian Nights*; D.S.
Richards – “One Thousand and One Nights – A History of the Text and Its Reception.”


“Thus an accurate portrayal of the *Nights* in pre-modern Arabic
literature must situate it within the rather fluid stratum of popular
fictional literary production and as a work that was in many ways
undifferentiated from a large body of similar texts. Many of these
popular narratives and collections were compiled and copied not for
personal, silent reading, but rather to function as the basis for public
story-telling performances…. It would therefore be singularly
inappropriate to approach a work drawn from this domain of popular
medieval literature with preconceptions derived from the modern Western
idea of a bounded, cohesive ‘text’ produced to be silently consumed by
solitary readers.” p.273
